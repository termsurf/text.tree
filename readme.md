### TuneBond

This is being developed by the folks at [TuneBond](https://tune.bond), a California-based project for helping humanity master information and computation. TuneBond started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a seed of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely bootstrapped by working full time and running [Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/tunebond) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tunebond), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tunebond), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tunebond). Check out our other GitHub projects as well!
